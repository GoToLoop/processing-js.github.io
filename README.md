Processing.js
=============

Processing.js was a port of the [Processing](https://processing.org) programming language for the web, and was maintained from November 2011 to December 2018, having been unofficially retired in March of 2017.

If you're looking for the last version of Processing.js before the project was officially discontinued, you're looking for [v1.6.6](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/tree/v1.6.6).

If you want to use Processing on the web today, please have a look at the newer [P5.js](https://p5js.org) project, which was a reimagining of Processing "if it had been designed for use on the web from the get-go".

Thank you to everyone who used Processing.js in the past, and of course: everyone who worked on the project over the years.
