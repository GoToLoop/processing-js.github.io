<h2>Latest release: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/processing-js">Processing.js v1.6.6</a></h2>

<p>Updates have been trickling in over the last few releases, and while the original dev team for Processing.js
moved on, there are a number of enthusiastic users who have been finding problems with the library and have been
willing to help fix them. As such, the current version has quite a few improvements compared to the version of
Processing.js you might find bundled with some processing bundles, but: if there are things it doesn't do that
you rely on, do head over to the Processing.js <a href="https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js">issue
tracker</a> and let people know.</p>

<h2>Want to help out?</h2>

<p>We're also happy to get help in the form of pull requests to add functionality to Pjs,
or to simply fix small errors that were found. You don't have to be a code wizard to contribute:
if you simply know of a function or a constant that's missing, feel free to fork the code,
patch what you think needs patching, and file a Pull Request so that we can merge your
improvement in! Don't know where to start? Drop into our IRC channel, #processingjs on
irc.mozilla.org, and we'll be happy to help you get the most out improving Processing.js!</p>

<h2>About Processing.js</h2>

<p>Processing.js is a project based on the popular <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a>
visual programming language, designed to bring Processing sketches to the web without a need for
special browser plugins. Processing.js makes your data visualizations, digital art, interactive
animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins.
You write code using the Processing language, include it in your web page, and Processing.js does
the rest. It's not magic, but it's close.</p>

<p>Originally developed by <a href="https://benfry.com/">Ben Fry</a> and <a href="https://reas.com/">
Casey Reas</a>, Processing started as an open source programming language based on Java to help
the electronic arts and visual design communities learn the basics of computer programming in a
visual context. Processing.js takes this to the next level, allowing Processing code to be run
by any HTML5 compatible browser, including current versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and
Internet Explorer. Processing.js brings the best of visual programming to the web, both for
Processing and web developers.</p>

<p>Everything you need to work with Processing.js is here. You can <a href="./download/">download</a>
the most recent version of Processing.js, read Quick Start Guides for
<a href="./articles/p5QuickStart.html">Processing Developers</a> or
<a href="./articles/jsQuickStart.html">JavaScript Developers</a>,
<a href="./learning/">learn</a> about the Processing language and Processing.js
<a href="./articles/RenderingModes.html">render modes</a>, consult the
<a href="./reference/">Reference</a>, and of course view many existing <a href="./exhibition/">demos</a>
that use Processing.js. You can also <a href="./community/">get involved</a> with the Processing
and Processing.js communities, both of which are active and and looking for new users and developers.</p>

<p>Whether you're an advanced Processing developer or completely new, whether you're a pro with
web technologies or just getting started, Processing.js bridges the
gap between these two powerful technologies.</p>
